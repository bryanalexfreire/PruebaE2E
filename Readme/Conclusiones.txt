Findings and Conclusions from the Web Automation Exercise with IntelliJ IDEA, Serenity BDD, Gherkin, Cucumber and the Screenplay Pattern

Findings
- The combination of IntelliJ IDEA, Serenity BDD, Cucumber and the Screenplay pattern supports a modular, maintainable automation architecture.
- IntelliJ IDEA provides helpful IDE features (autocomplete, navigation, refactoring) that speed up development and reduce errors.
- Gherkin feature files and Cucumber step definitions improve communication between technical and non-technical team members.
- The Screenplay pattern (tasks, interactions, questions) enables clear separation of concerns and encourages reusable components.
- Test stability depends on driver/browser version compatibility and reliable element locators; flaky locators or mismatched WebDriver versions were the main instability sources.
- Default timeouts were long in several places; unifying short explicit waits (2 seconds) for quick checks reduced unnecessary delays but may require adjustment for less stable environments.

Conclusions
- The selected stack is appropriate for scalable acceptance and E2E tests: it facilitates readable specifications and maintainable automation code.
- Adopting the Screenplay pattern improved modularity and reusability, making it easier to extend tests and onboard new team members.
- Ensuring environment parity (browser and WebDriver versions) and robust locators is critical to achieving stable CI runs.

Recommendations
- Use matching browser driver versions for the target browser (Chrome or Edge) on local and CI agents. Prefer the official driver downloads:
  - ChromeDriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
  - EdgeDriver: https://developer.microsoft.com/es-es/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver?form=MA13LH
- Keep short explicit waits for quick UI checks (2 seconds) and increase only when needed for specific unstable interactions.
- Centralize timeout values in a configuration file to avoid scattered “magic numbers” in code.
- Improve locator resilience: prefer stable attributes (data-test-id, ids) or robust XPath/CSS expressions.
- Add CI pipeline validation that verifies driver/browser compatibility before running the full test suite.

Next steps
- Create a configuration file or constants class to manage timeouts and driver settings.
- Replace any remaining Spanish comments and messages with English for consistency across the codebase.
- Add a lightweight smoke test that runs quickly on CI to catch environment issues early.
